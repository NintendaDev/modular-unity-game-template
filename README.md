# Modular Unity Game Template

![============ GIF DEMONSTRATION ============](images/demo.gif)

This project is based on the following key ideas:
- Controlled game loading
- Modular development
- Minimal use of MonoBehaviour

The controlled game loading is achieved by using a state machine for game phases (Bootstrap, Loading, Game Menu, Gameplay Levels) and avoiding the use of Awake in MonoBehaviour scripts.
The implementation is based on this approach and utilizes Zenject, Addressables, and UniTask.

The main idea of modular development is to create game functionality in the form of small, independent modules. For example, a separate module for analytics, advertising, asset management, and more. A module is independent of the implementation of a specific game, allowing it to be easily reused in other games.

In the modular approach, the game is suggested to be built using integration code that connects the operations of various independent modules. In this project, the modules are located in the folder Assets/Modules, and the integration code is in the folder Assets/Game/Scripts.

Minimal use of MonoBehaviour is achieved through the use of a DI framework. In gameplay, this is further enhanced by utilizing the Entity class, which is populated with the necessary objects via DI framework installers.

**The template includes:**
- Independent modules for use in integration code and other projects
- An example implementation of the main menu, featuring authentication, volume control, and level selection (integration code)
- An example implementation of 2D platformer gameplay (integration code)

The UI is implemented using the MVP Passive View pattern.

**The following solutions have been implemented in the project**

- Integrating analytics (GameAnalytics, Firebase)
- Implementing ads (AppLovin)
- Localization system (I2)
- Authorization integration
- Music management and volume control (Sonity)
- Progress saving
- Managing in-game currency and player statistics
- And more

**Dependencies:**

- Zenject (free)
- Addressables (free)
- UniTask (free)
- R3 (free)
- TextMesh Pro (free)
- Odin Inspector (paid)
- Odin Validator (paid)
- I2 Localization (paid)
- Sonity (paid)
- GameAnalytics (free)

Paid assets require a purchase. In the project, they are included solely for the purpose of demonstrating functionality.

By default, analytics is implemented using GameAnalytics. Firebase Analytics is available as an additional addon in .unitypackage format. The AppLovin ad network is also implemented as an addon. Both addons are located in the Assets/Addons folder.

**Design Patterns Used:**

- Dependency Injection (DI)
- State
- Event Bus
- Factory
- Model View Presenter Passive View
- Model View Observable
- Facade
- Template Method
- Proxy
- Repository
- Chain of responsibility
- and more

## Flow Description
![Flow](/images/flow-scheme.png)

**Bootstrap Scene**
This is the entry point of the game.
It creates the game's state machine and sequentially initializes all services to ensure their correct operation.

**Loading Scene**

This scene loads the game state before showing the player the main menu. If the user is authorized, their account information is loaded. Then, the game transitions to the state of loading the player's saved progress. Any other state that needs to be executed before showing the player the main game menu can be inserted here.

**Game Hub Scene**

The main game menu. The scene's state begins with Bootstrap, where the necessary services for the game menu scene can be initialized. After the Bootstrap scene state, the Main scene state is activated, and the game menu appears. In this menu, the player can select a level to play, access settings, and perform authorization. If authorization is successful, the state transitions to Loading, the Loading Scene is loaded, and the game reloads data considering the player's authorization. If authorization fails, the game state does not change.

To support loading player progress based on their authorization, the save service needs to be refined for the specific project.

**Gameplay Scene**

The Gameplay state loads the level, which creates the level's state machine. The level state starts with the Bootstrap state, where all the services needed solely for gameplay can be initialized.

Next, the state transitions to Start. Here, for example, the player can be shown an advertisement, and a message can be sent to analytics about the start of the level. After this, the scene transitions to the Play state, where the level is shown to the player, and the game can begin. There is also a Pause state, which the player enters by pressing the pause button on the screen. From the Pause state, the player can either return to the game or exit it via the UI.

Upon exiting, the game transitions to the Finish state. Here, as well, an advertisement can be shown to the player, and data can be sent to analytics about the end of the game. The Finish state transitions to the Game Hub state, and the main menu scene is loaded.
